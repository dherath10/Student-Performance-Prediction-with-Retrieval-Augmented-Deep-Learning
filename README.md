**Mendeley Student Dataset**

This dataset, compiled from Mendeley Data, contains 1,194 student records with 31 attributes. It includes academic indicators (such as SGPA, credits
earned, and backlogs), behavioral characteristics (such as attendance and probation status), and demographic information (such as gender, parental education, and income level). The target variable, which supports regression-based performance prediction, is the student's current semester SGPA.
